# Home credit default risk

This repository contains Jyputer Notebook for building various ML models for `predicting home defaults` based on various customers' data obtained by the bank.

It's part of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competition ([Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/overview) competition).

At first EDA was done, based on which I tried to do feature engineering.
For classification `logistic regression` and `random forest` models were trained and evaluated only on training set (test dataset is not available as that's how Kaggle scores your model).
Those models were built using different set of features.


## Running Jupyter Notebook
I recommend viewing and running notebook files with [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index),
so you won't have to manage any of the python requirements compared with running them locally.
